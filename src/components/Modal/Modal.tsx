        Finally, Jules embarks on his recovery journey. He begins therapy,
        attends 12-step meetings, and embraces a spiritual journey towards
        sobriety. This phase involves self-discovery, dealing with loss, and
        continuously seeking growth, ultimately leading his to a place of
        self-acceptance and confidence. Julesâ€™ story reflects not just the
        struggle with addiction but also the resilience and courage it takes to
        reclaim one's life and identity in the face of such challenges.
